<h2>Introduction to Kotlin</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<h5 id="what-is-kotlin">What is Kotlin?</h5><p>Kotlin is a highly effective modern programming language developed by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>. It has a very clear and concise syntax, which makes your code easy to read. </p><p>Kotlin is widely used around the world, and its popularity among developers is constantly growing. Many developers who use Kotlin note that it makes their work faster and more exciting :)</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Logo Kotlin" height="67" src="https://ucarecdn.com/d3ec070f-92aa-4473-af87-20d486a424a4/" width="300"/></p><p>The basic syntax of Kotlin is similar to Java, but it has numerous important differences. One of these features is extension features, which offer developers the ability to extend the functionality of classes without having to use inheritance. Moreover, Kotlin offers type inference, allowing the compiler to determine the type of variable based on context, which simplifies coding and reduces the number of errors in complex programs.</p><h5 id="a-brief-history-of-kotlin">A brief history of Kotlin</h5><p>In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled the Kotlin Project, a new language for the Java Platform, which had been in development for a year. The name comes from Kotlin Island near St. Petersburg, Russia. The primary goal of this project was to provide a safer and more concise alternative to Java in all the contexts where Java is currently used.</p><p>In 2016, the first official stable version was released (Kotlin v1.0). The developer community was already interested in using this language, especially on Android.</p><p>At the Google I/O 2017 conference, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android. Chet Haase, the chief advocate for Android, said: "We understand that not everybody is on Kotlin right now, but we believe that you should get there".</p><p>At this moment, Kotlin is considered as a general-purpose language for many platforms, not only for Android. The language has several releases a year. The latest version can be found <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">on the official site</a>.</p><h5 id="a-sample-kotlin-function">A sample Kotlin function</h5><p>Here is a sample of a simple function in Kotlin programming language that prints <code class="language-kotlin">Hello, Kotlin!</code>. </p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}</code></pre><p>For now, you do not need to understand how this function works, just enjoy it! :)</p><h5 id="application-platforms-for-kotlin-jvm-android-js-native">Application platforms for Kotlin: JVM, Android, JS, Native</h5><p>Kotlin can be used in a variety of application platforms, such as JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Android, JavaScript, and Native. It is known for its flexibility and ease-of-use when it comes to developing software for different platforms.</p><p>For example, developers who are familiar with Java can easily learn how to use Kotlin on Android devices. The same is true for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to develop applications for the web using Kotlin.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JVM</a>: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java source code and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too. At the same time, developers can use Kotlin as the only language for their projects without Java at all.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.android.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>: using Kotlin syntax, you can create mobile applications for Android, the most used operating system in the world.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.javascript.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JS</a>: Kotlin is also compatible with JavaScript, which enables you to develop client-side web applications and run them in a browser.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Native</a>: Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native binaries which can be run on any OS such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and macOS.</p></li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Kotlin Programming Language for JVM Android Browser Native" height="698" src="https://ucarecdn.com/28192c0c-2d02-4503-8948-034efaddb8a0/" width="1600"/></p><p>Among all these opportunities, modern programmers prefer mobile and server-side development, but other areas are gaining popularity as well.</p><h5 id="features-functional-programming-object-oriented-programming-and-more">Features: functional programming, object-oriented programming and more</h5><p>Kotlin is designed as a pragmatic language, which means that its main purpose is solving real-world problems rather than completing research purposes. </p><p>It is also important that Kotlin supports multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming, functional programming, and more. Kotlin also offers tools like anonymous functions and higher-order functions, which allow developers to easily create abstractions over existing code.</p><p>Last but not least, Kotlin is a tool-friendly language, which means all popular types of development tools, such as <u>IntelliJ IDEA</u>, <u>Eclipse</u>, and <u>Android Studio</u>, are compatible with it.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Now, you know what Kotlin is, how it developed, and where it is used. You've learned some of the characteristic features of the language that make it so special. You've also seen your first lines of Kotlin code. There'll be more soon, promise.</p>
